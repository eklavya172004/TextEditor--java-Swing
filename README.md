Overview
This is a Java-based text editor built using Swing components and the Java Collections Framework. It provides a wide range of text editing functionalities, allowing users to create, save, load, and edit documents with additional features like font styling, text search, and geometric shape insertion.

#Features
1. Document Management
Create and Save: Users can type a document and save it in the desired file format.
Load Document: Load an existing document from the saved location for editing.
2. Text Editing Functionalities
Cut, Copy, Paste: Standard text editing options to move or duplicate text.

Find and Replace:
Search for a word in the document.
Replace a specific word or all occurrences of a word with a new word.
Word and Character Count:
Displays the total number of words and characters for the selected text.
3. Geometric Shapes
Insert up to 5 basic geometric shapes (e.g., circle, rectangle, line, ellipse, triangle) into the document.
Control the size of the shapes dynamically using mouse motions.
Technology Used
Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
Java Collections Framework: For efficient data handling and operations.
File I/O: For saving and loading document files.
